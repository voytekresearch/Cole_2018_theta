# Cole_2018_theta
Analysis code to create the figures in ([SR Cole & B Voytek. 2018. Hippocampal theta bursting and waveform shape reflect CA1 spiking patterns. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/25/452987))

Each notebook corresponds to 1 figure in the paper. The code heavily utilizes libraries in [bycycle](https://github.com/voytekresearch/bycycle), a toolbox for cycle-by-cycle analysis of brain rhythms, and [neurodsp](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp), a toolbox for analyzing neural oscillations.
