# Cole_2018_theta
Analysis code to create the figures in "Hippocampal theta bursting and waveform shape reflect CA1 spiking patterns" [Cole & Voytek 2018, bioRxiv] (link TBD)

Each notebook corresponds to 1 figure in the paper. The code heavily utilizes libraries in [bycycle](https://github.com/voytekresearch/bycycle), a toolbox for cycle-by-cycle analysis of brain rhythms, and [neurodsp](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp), a toolbox for analyzing neural oscillations.
